# SR-Flip-Flop
SR Flip-Flop (Set-Reset Flip-Flop)
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of an SR Flip-Flop, a basic bistable storage element commonly used in digital circuits to store a single bit of data. It is one of the simplest types of flip-flops, providing basic set and reset functionality.

Overview
The SR Flip-Flop is a fundamental sequential logic circuit with two inputs:

S (Set): Sets the output to 1.
R (Reset): Resets the output to 0.
The flip-flop stores a single bit of data and maintains its state until the inputs are changed
